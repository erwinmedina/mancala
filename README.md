# Mancala

## History / Background

Mancala is a two-player turn based strategy board game. The objective of this game is to capture more pieces than your opponent, with the pieces being represented by variety of items such as seeds, stones, beans, or gems. There is evidence that suggests that the game originated in 7th century Ancient Egypt, and it is among the oldest known games still played today.
The game also goes by a variety of different names, such as, "Ali Guli Mane" in Southern India, "Oware" in West Africa, "Warra" or "Kalah" in the United States back in the early 1940's.

## Rules

1. Gameplay starts with Player 1 picking up all of the pieces in any one of the containers on his/her side.
2. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits 1 stone in each pocket until the stones run out.
3. If you run into your own Mancala (store), deposit 1 stone. Otherwise if you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip it, and move to the next available container.
4. If the last piece you drop is in your own Mancala, take another turn.
5. If the last piece you drop is in an empty container on your side, capture that piece along with any pieces in the container directly opposite to it.
6. Game ends when all 6 pockets on 1 side of the board are empty.

## Getting Started

[Click here to get to the game](https://erwinmedina.github.io/mancala/)

Player 1 starts on the bottom of the board with the initial color of blue. Simply click on any of the 6 available containers on your side of the board to initiate. Player 2 will do the same for their side of the board. 
If players dislike their respective color, they can adjust it on the left hand side with the colorpicker. 

## Icebox Items

- Implementing stones in a 3D or creative manner to illustrate realism.
- Create a mobile version that made sense. Having a long board prevented me from doing so in the early stages.
- Keep the aside visible when picking a color.
- And fix the 'help' button so that it always loads the picture.
